I named myself **bean** on my first English class in the middle school, after reading the series *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, i decided to extend the name with suffix 'towel' so that **beantowel** will be more unique and fun. **Cao** is my real first name. The blog is primarily for sharing tech notes, or maybe it's just another form of self-taking since no comments is supported by the simple static pages :).
